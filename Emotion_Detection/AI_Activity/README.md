# Emotion Detection using DistilBERT Model

This project is an implementation of emotion detection in Python using a pre-trained model (`bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion`) from Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The program takes an input text and returns emotion scores for various emotions like joy, sadness, anger, etc.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `transformers` and `torch` libraries

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository or create the project folder
